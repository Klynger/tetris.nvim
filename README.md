# `tetris.nvim`

This project was built as a way for me to learn Lua, explore NeoVim plugin development, and gain a better understanding of game development. I don’t recommend using this code as a learning resource since it likely contains mistakes. I’m a web developer, and the last time I built a game was back in 2014 when I was learning to program in college.

I’m doing this because I want to learn something new, and I’m terrible at coming up with useful project ideas.

This project is not related to [`nvim-tetris`](https://github.com/alec-gibson/nvim-tetris).
